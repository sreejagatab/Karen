Let’s learn about the TIME MACHINE that was discovered in Canada
But first….some questions.  See how answers you know

2. What is the smallest plant life on Earth?
3. What is the most abundant plant life on Earth?
4. What does NASA call The Most Important Plant Life?
5. What food supports the ENTIRE OCEAN that includes whales?
6. What provides Earth the majority of oxygen?
7. What is the origin source of LIFE, FOOD, & NUTRITION?

9. Do you know what it is?  Why is this fundamental nutrient hidden?
Sometimes the most obvious solutions are overlooked
The answer is…..

It is a single cell plant 1/3 the size of a blood cell.   Inside the plant is pure source nutrition that absorbs directly your cells WITHOUT DIGESTION
Military Grade Ocean Water Filtration, No pesticides, no fertilizer, FDA approved facility 
Already market tested with arguably the highest quality reviews in history
If your mom knew…..this is the supplement she would have given you instead of Cod Liver Oil

How To Take It
It’s a vibrant green powder.  Mix with water or your favourite COLD beverage.
Each scoop/serving can feed over 90,000,000,000 of your cells
Direct nourishment for your mitochondria which is the engine of your body
Fueling your mitochondria with pure source nutrition is like turning on a generator during a power outage.
If you are living life like you have a few blown circuit breakers…..Congratulations!  You are in the right place.  
If you can afford $2/day you can now turn the power back on and change the trajectory of your life

Why is it named Karen?
Karen is the original Phytoplankton brand.   Originally named in honor of a nurse from Maple Ridge, BC Canada who unnecessarily suffered and left us at 46.   Our goal is to change this trajectory of constant health issues for the populace.  Yes, the meme came out, but of course back 25 years ago we all knew a Karen who was cool.  Again, let’s go back in time when things weren’t so negative.
